\# Java Vending Machine Project ☕



This project represents my learning journey in Core Java.



\- \*\*`JavaVendingMachineOriginal.java`\*\* — My original version of the vending machine project, written as I was exploring loops, arrays, and conditionals.  

\- \*\*`JavaVendingMachineRefined.java`\*\* — The improved version built after revisiting concepts and getting feedback from ChatGPT by OpenAI.



This repository is a small milestone in my transition into software development — showing how I’m refining logic, structure, and readability step by step.



🚀 Every commit is a lesson learned.
